Gambler.py v-1.0

Gambler is a python libraray that mimics the behavior of a deck of cards. it can be run as both a standalone in a terminal (for when you want to play virtual card cames,) or imported into a python project that might need a deck of cards.

if you have any imrovements or additons for it, feel free to make a pull request or message me your idea.
possible future updates might include:
-support for multiplayer games past two players
-accurate systematic shuffling, as opposed to random shuffles
-a possible pygame graphical version
